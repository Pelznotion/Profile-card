# Frontend Wizards — Stage 1: Multi-Page Profile Site

## Overview

This project is part of the **Frontend Wizards Program**, Stage 1.  
It builds upon my Stage 0 “Profile Card” by expanding into a **multi-page application** with semantic, accessible, and responsive design.

### Pages

1. **Home (`index.html`)** — The original profile card.
2. **About Me (`about.html`)** — Reflections, goals, and personal notes.
3. **Contact Us (`contact.html`)** — A contact form with HTML + JS validation.
